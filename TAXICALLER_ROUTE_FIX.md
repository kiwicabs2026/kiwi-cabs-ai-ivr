# ðŸš– TaxiCaller Route Distance & Duration Fix

## Problem
TaxiCaller support reported that the IVR system was sending bookings with **hardcoded distance and duration values** (5000m and 600 seconds) for every booking. This caused the dispatch map to show incorrect route information.

**TaxiCaller's Response:**
> "Our system simply displays what it received in the request; it doesn't calculate the route, distance, or duration automatically. That information needs to come in the request."

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. New Function: `get_route_distance_and_duration()`
Added a new function that uses **Google Maps Directions API** to calculate actual route information:

```python
def get_route_distance_and_duration(pickup_address, destination_address):
    """
    Get actual distance and duration from Google Maps Directions API
    Returns: (distance_in_meters, duration_in_seconds)
    """
```

**Features:**
- Uses Google Maps Directions API (already configured in the app)
- Returns actual distance in meters
- Returns actual duration in seconds
- Falls back to defaults (5000m, 600s) if Google Maps is unavailable
- Adds Wellington context automatically

### 2. Updated Booking Payload
Modified `send_booking_to_taxicaller()` to use actual route data in **TWO places**:

**Location 1 - Route Meta (line 980):**
```python
"route": {
    "meta": {"est_dur": str(duration_seconds), "dist": str(distance_meters)},  # Actual values!
    ...
}
```

**Location 2 - Route Legs (line 1004):**
```python
"legs": [
    {
        "pts": pickup_coords + dropoff_coords,
        "meta": {"dist": str(distance_meters), "est_dur": str(duration_seconds)},  # Actual values!
        "from_seq": 0,
        "to_seq": 1
    }
]
```

Both locations now use the actual calculated distance and duration from Google Maps instead of hardcoded values.

## What Changed

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Distance | Hardcoded 5000m | Actual from Google Maps |
| Duration | Hardcoded 600s | Actual from Google Maps |
| Route Map | Straight line | Correct route |
| Every Booking | Same values | Unique values per route |

---

## How It Works

1. **Booking Created** â†’ Customer provides pickup and destination
2. **Route Calculated** â†’ Google Maps Directions API calculates actual route
3. **Data Extracted** â†’ Distance (meters) and Duration (seconds) extracted
4. **Sent to TaxiCaller** â†’ Booking includes correct route information
5. **Dispatch Map** â†’ TaxiCaller shows accurate route and distance

---

## Requirements

âœ… **Google Maps API Key** - Already configured in the app
âœ… **Directions API Enabled** - Must be enabled in Google Cloud Console
âœ… **Valid Addresses** - Pickup and destination must be valid locations

---

## Testing

To verify the fix is working:

1. Create a booking with specific pickup and destination
2. Check the logs for: `ðŸ“Š Route data: XXXXm, XXXXs`
3. Verify TaxiCaller shows correct distance and route

---

## Fallback Behavior

If Google Maps is unavailable or returns an error:
- Distance: 5000 meters (default)
- Duration: 600 seconds (default)
- Booking still succeeds with reasonable defaults

---

## Files Modified

- **app.py**
  - Added `get_route_distance_and_duration()` function (line 812)
  - Updated route meta in booking payload (line 980)
  - Updated route legs meta in booking payload (line 1004)
  - Both now use actual distance and duration from Google Maps

---

## Result

âœ… TaxiCaller now receives **accurate route information** for every booking
âœ… Dispatch map shows **correct distance and route**
âœ… No more hardcoded values
âœ… Booking creation still works with fallback defaults

**Issue Resolved!** ðŸŽ‰
